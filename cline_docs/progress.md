# Progress: EI-harness-lite (As of 2025-04-06 02:24 PM ET)

## What Works

*   **Core Structure:** The basic project structure with separation for models, utilities, tests, and deployment scripts is in place.
*   **Gemini API Integration:** Successfully integrated and debugged interaction with the Gemini API using the `google-generativeai` v0.8.4 SDK.
*   **Superprompt Handling:** Implemented prepending of the superprompt to user input to ensure context is passed correctly.
*   **Basic Caching:** In-memory caching implemented in `GeminiModel` with statistics tracking (hits, misses, savings).
*   **Streamlit Application:** Functional Streamlit UI (`gemini_app.py`) with chat interface, metrics display, superprompt editor, and cache savings visibility. UI rendering issues fixed.
*   **Deployment Pipeline:** A process exists and was successfully used for deploying the Gemini application to GCP using Docker and Cloud Build (`deploy_gemini_to_gcp_cloudbuild.py`).
*   **Testing Framework:** Pytest is set up for running tests.

## What's Left to Build / Current Focus (Planning Phase)

1.  **Local Logging Interface:** Design and implement a local logging system for admin/user review, replacing the previous Supabase approach.
2.  **Caching & Metrics Enhancement:**
    *   Review the effectiveness of the current prepending + in-memory caching strategy.
    *   Investigate if further optimization of Gemini API caching is possible/needed for the current SDK.
    *   Enhance metrics collection (e.g., latency breakdown) and display for better scalability insights.
3.  **Scaling & Testing Strategy:**
    *   Define scaling strategies for the GCP Cloud Run deployment (auto-scaling, instance types, etc.).
    *   Identify potential performance bottlenecks (API limits, Cloud Run limits).
    *   Plan for load testing (e.g., using Locust) and potentially synthetic data generation.
4.  **Authentication (Lower Priority):** Plan the implementation of user authentication.
5.  **`js-client` Clarification:** Understand the purpose and status of the `js-client/` directory.
6.  **Image Generation/Analysis Integration (Deferred):** Multi-modal features are currently deferred based on new priorities.
7.  **Documentation:** Update `GemiGrok/OverviewgFlash2.md` (or create if not done) to reflect the current state and plans.

## Future Enhancements

*   Emotive Text-to-Speech integration.
*   Agentic capabilities.
*   User-specific data analysis and visualization.

## Overall Status

*   **MAJOR CHECKPOINT REACHED:** The core Gemini text generation application is functional, debugged, includes basic caching with metrics, and is successfully deployed to GCP.
*   The current phase focuses on planning improvements for logging, caching robustness, metrics, scalability, and testing based on user feedback.
*   Memory Bank is up-to-date.
