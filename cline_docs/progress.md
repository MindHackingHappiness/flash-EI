# Progress: EI-harness-lite (As of 2025-04-06 06:26 PM ET)

## What Works

*   **Core Structure:** Basic project structure with models, utilities, tests, deployment scripts.
*   **Gemini API Integration:** Successfully migrated to and integrated with the **`google-genai` SDK (v1.0+)**. API calls are functional.
*   **Superprompt Handling & Context Caching:** Implemented **Gemini Context Caching**. `GeminiModel` now creates/manages persistent caches for the superprompt (`system_instruction`) via `client.caches.create`. `generate_content` calls reference this cache, sending only user input/history. This replaces the previous prepending method.
*   **Cache Management & Stats:** Added methods to `GeminiModel` for clearing context caches. Implemented statistics tracking for context cache hits/misses and estimated savings.
*   **Streamlit Application:** Functional UI (`gemini_app.py`) with chat, metrics, superprompt editor. Includes controls for enabling/disabling/clearing context cache and displays cache stats. UI rendering issues fixed. Export functionality fixed. "Cache Test" tab added.
*   **Deployment Pipeline:** GCP Cloud Build pipeline (`deploy_gemini_to_gcp_cloudbuild.py`) successfully deployed the application.
*   **Testing Framework:** Pytest setup exists.

## What's Left to Build / Current Focus

1.  **Test Context Caching:** Verify the new implementation functions correctly via the "Cache Test" tab and logs. Confirm cache hits/misses and savings reporting.
2.  **Styling Improvements:** Address UI styling issues (colors, layout) in `gemini_app.py`. Consider adding theme options.
3.  **Local Logging Interface:** Implement robust local file logging for requests, responses, errors, and cache events. Ensure logs are being written correctly.
4.  **Scaling & Testing Strategy:** Define GCP scaling strategies, identify bottlenecks, plan load testing (Locust).
5.  **Authentication (Lower Priority):** Plan user authentication implementation.
6.  **`js-client` Clarification:** Understand the purpose and status of the `js-client/` directory.
7.  **Image Generation/Analysis Integration (Deferred):** Multi-modal features deferred.
8.  **Documentation:** Update `GemiGrok/OverviewgFlash2.md`.

## Future Enhancements

*   Emotive Text-to-Speech integration.
*   Agentic capabilities.
*   User-specific data analysis and visualization.

## Overall Status

*   **MAJOR CHECKPOINT REACHED:** Core app migrated to the new `google-genai` SDK, Context Caching implemented, UI issues fixed, deployed to GCP.
*   Current phase focuses on **testing the new Context Caching implementation**, followed by styling improvements and logging setup.
*   Memory Bank is up-to-date.
