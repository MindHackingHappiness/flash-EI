# Active Context

## Current Task (As of 2025-04-06 02:24 PM ET)

**MAJOR CHECKPOINT REACHED:** The Gemini Streamlit application has been successfully debugged and deployed to Google Cloud Platform using Cloud Build.

**Current Focus Areas (Planning Phase):**

1.  **Local Logging:** Design and implement a local logging interface, replacing the previous Supabase approach.
2.  **Caching & Metrics Enhancement:**
    *   Review and potentially refine the current Gemini API caching mechanism (superprompt prepending + in-memory cache).
    *   Ensure optimal use of Gemini's caching features.
    *   Improve metrics collection and display for scalability analysis.
3.  **Scaling & Testing Strategy:**
    *   Develop plans for scaling the application on GCP.
    *   Identify potential bottlenecks.
    *   Outline testing strategies (e.g., load testing with Locust).
4.  **Authentication (Lower Priority):** Plan for adding user authentication.
5.  **Future Exploration:** Consider agents, user data visualization, and multimodal features.

## Recent Changes (Since 2025-04-05)

*   **Gemini API Debugging:** Iteratively debugged and fixed issues with `google-generativeai` SDK v0.8.4 API calls (`generate_content`, `contents` formatting, `system` role handling).
*   **Caching Optimization:**
    *   Implemented prepending of the superprompt to user input in `EIHarness` to work around the lack of system role support.
    *   Added cache statistics tracking (hits, misses, savings) to `GeminiModel`.
    *   Updated Streamlit UI to display cache savings.
*   **UI Fix:** Refactored Streamlit chat message display to use `st.chat_message` and `st.caption`, resolving broken HTML rendering.
*   **Deployment:** Successfully deployed the application to GCP via Cloud Build using the `deploy_gemini_to_gcp_cloudbuild.py` script.

## Next Steps (Planning)

1.  Update `cline_docs/progress.md`.
2.  Discuss and refine plans for Local Logging, Caching/Metrics, and Scaling/Testing with the user.
3.  Prioritize implementation steps based on user feedback.
