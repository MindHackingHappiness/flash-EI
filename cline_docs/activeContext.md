# Active Context

## Current Task (As of 2025-04-06 06:24 PM ET)

**MAJOR CHECKPOINT REACHED:** The Gemini Streamlit application has been successfully debugged, deployed to GCP, and refactored to use the latest `google-genai` SDK with **Context Caching**.

**Current Focus Areas:**

1.  **Testing Context Caching:** Verify the new Context Caching implementation works as expected using the "Cache Test" tab and observing logs/metrics.
2.  **Styling Improvements:** Address UI styling issues (colors, layout) in `gemini_app.py`.
3.  **Local Logging:** Implement the planned local logging interface.
4.  **Scaling & Testing Strategy:** Define scaling plans and testing approaches (Locust).
5.  **Authentication (Lower Priority):** Plan for adding user authentication.

## Recent Changes (Since 2025-04-06 02:24 PM ET)

*   **SDK Migration:** Migrated from `google-generativeai` to the newer `google-genai` SDK (v1.0+). Updated requirements and refactored code accordingly.
*   **Context Caching Implementation:** Refactored `GeminiModel` to use the explicit Context Caching feature (`client.caches.create`, `GenerationConfig(cached_content=...)`) based on SDK documentation. Added cache management methods and stats tracking.
*   **Streamlit UI Updates:** Added a "Cache Test" tab and cache management controls (enable/disable checkbox, clear button) to `gemini_app.py`. Updated cache stats display.
*   **Error Resolution:** Fixed various `ImportError`, `TypeError`, and `SyntaxError` issues encountered during refactoring and testing.
*   **Memory Bank Update:** Updated `techContext.md` and `systemPatterns.md` with SDK and caching details.

## Next Steps

1.  Update `cline_docs/progress.md`.
2.  Test the Context Caching implementation via the Streamlit app.
3.  Address Streamlit styling issues.
4.  Implement local logging.
